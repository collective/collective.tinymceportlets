Introduction
============

This product allows you to add portlets within TinyMCE.

It adds a button to tiny mce to allow you to choose portlets from the normal
plone right and left columns, or add a portlet to that item for use only with
TinyMCE.

It works by using plone.transformchain to add the portlets into the document
after it has been rendered.
