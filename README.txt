Introduction
============

This product allows you to add portlets within TinyMCE.

It adds a button to tiny mce to allow you to choose portlets from the normal
plone right and left columns(or any extra portlet managers available).

It works by using plone.transformchain to add the portlets into the document
after it has been rendered.

Only tested on Plone 4.1 but could work on other versions.

On Plone 4.1, you'll have to pin plone.formwidget.contenttree::

	[versions]
	...
	plone.formwidget.contenttree = 1.0.4
	...
